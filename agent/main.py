Available tool tips:
- get_latest_messages: Use when asked for recent messages, news, or updates from Telegram channels
- schedule_task: Use to schedule reminders or future tasks - requires JSON with prompt, run_at, chat_id, task_name
- list_scheduled_tasks: Show all pending scheduled tasks
- cancel_scheduled_task: Cancel a task by its ID"""

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).

Valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names}

Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```

Follow this format:

Question: input question to answer

Observation: action result
